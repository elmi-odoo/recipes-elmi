I think I am getting a hang of managing these files in github.
When I make a repo, it is on github. I had to change directories with cd .. and then I went back down using cd [reponame]. Then I clone it from github using the SSH key.

Let me add more... I will save my file in VS code. Then use git status to see what was updated. Use git add . to stage everything that is new/modified. To make the snapshot, use git commit m- "Your Message". Finally, to push use git push origin [branch name] - so it is usually git push origin main.
